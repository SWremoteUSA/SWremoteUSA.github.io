                          <p class="lead">To help focus our work for the weekend and address key topics related to the Covid-19 health emergency, we’ve identified several themes. Winners will be selected from each of these:</p>
                          <p class="lead">
                          <ul style="color:black;font-size:18px;padding-left:20px;">
                            <li>Health: Address and scale a range of health initiatives, including preventative/hygiene behaviors (especially for at-risk countries and populations), supporting frontline health workers, scaling telemedicine, contact tracing/containment strategies, treatment and diagnosis development.</li>
                            <li>Vulnerable Populations: The set of problems facing the elderly and the immuno-compromised, such as access to meals and groceries, and supporting those who are losing jobs and income.</li>
                            <li>Businesses: The set of problems that businesses are facing to stay afloat, collaborate effectively, and move parts of their business online.</li>
                            <li>Community: Promoting connection to friends, family, and neighbors to combat social isolation and the digitizing of public services for local governments.</li>
                            <li>Education: Alternative learning environments and tools for students, teachers, and entire school systems.</li>
                            <li>Entertainment: Alternatives to traditional forms of entertainment that can keep the talent and audiences safe and healthy.</li>

                          <p class="lead">In order to craft a similar experience for everyone, we’ve tried to account for schedules of people in different time zones by creating a site and platform for those in the Eastern and Central time zones (East) and those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones (West). Please sign up accordingly!<br><br>
                          </p>
                          <h4>How does the “East” and “West” region work?</h4>
                          <p class="lead">We recognized that someone is Albany, NY will get off work 3 hours earlier than someone in Portland, OR. So we set up the schedule to help match the schedules more easily. However we are still running one nation-wide event. You can work in teams with anyone you want, from anywhere in the country. But you will see some of the timing will depend on your timezone, and others will be “live” and therefore fixed across all timezones.</p>

                          <p class="lead">Each Startup Weekend has several key elements, but in order to organize this special event, we’ve shifted a few and added some time on the front end to enable the discussions and project exploration that lead to forming the best teams possible. Here’s how our modified schedule runs:</p>
                          <h4>How does a normal Startup Weekend work?</h4>
                          <p class="lead">All Startup Weekends have the same 7 key activities:</p>
                            <p class="lead">

                              <li>Enroll your teams</li>
                              <li>Begin working</li>
                              <li>Submit for Judging</li>

                            </ul>
                          </p>
                          <h4>How does a remote Startup Weekend work?</h4>
                          <p class="lead">
                            <ul style="color:black;font-size:18px;padding-left:20px;">
                              <li>Register Now and consider inviting your friends to do the same! (Deadline Wednesday, 4/22 11:59 PM EDT/PDT)</li>

                            </ul>
                          </p>
                          <h4>What’s the time commitment?</h4>
                          <p class="lead">Just like a standard Startup Weekend, we are expecting everyone to make this their focus for the full weekend.That generally means attending the kickoff on Friday night, working with teams, mentors and facilitators through the weekend and attending the closing event on Sunday night. See the event schedule overview on this page.
                            <br><br>However, since we aren’t all together in a single location, it’s up to each team to stay focused. You will need to stay actively connected and engaged with each other, your facilitator, the agenda and the process. That also means that if you have family or other obligations, you can work with your team members to help each other out and juggle those commitments.
